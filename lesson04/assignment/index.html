          <h3>Who invented motion picture?</h3>
          <img alt="inside of a kinetoscope" class="kinetoscope-img" src="img/kinetoscope-750.jpg">
          <p>No one person invented cinema. However, in 1891 the Edison Company successfully demonstrated a prototype of the Kinetoscope, which enabled one person at a time to view moving pictures.</p>
          <p>The first public Kinetoscope demonstration took place in 1893. By 1894 the Kinetoscope was a commercial success, with public parlours established around the world.</p>
          <p>The first to present projected moving pictures to a paying audience were the Lumière brothers in December 1895 in Paris, France. They used a device of their own making, the Cinématographe, which was a camera, a projector and a film printer all in one.</p>
