        <h2>Invention of Cinema</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>Who invented motion picture?</h3>
          <img alt="inside of a kinetoscope" class="kinetoscope-img" src="img/kinetoscope-750.jpg">
          <p>No one person invented cinema. However, in 1891 the Edison Company successfully demonstrated a prototype of the Kinetoscope, which enabled one person at a time to view moving pictures.</p>
          <p>The first public Kinetoscope demonstration took place in 1893. By 1894 the Kinetoscope was a commercial success, with public parlours established around the world.</p>
          <p>The first to present projected moving pictures to a paying audience were the Lumière brothers in December 1895 in Paris, France. They used a device of their own making, the Cinématographe, which was a camera, a projector and a film printer all in one.</p>

          <h3>When was color added?</h3>
          <p>Color was first added to black-and-white movies through hand coloring, tinting, toning and stencilling.</p>
          <p>Color was more widely used after the introduction of Technicolor's three‑colour process in 1932. <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYj0M19Ap34&t=5s" target="_blank">Gone With the Wind</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFuFnRLRb_E" target="_blank">The Wizard of Oz</a></em> (both 1939) used this process.</p>

          <h3>Aspect Ratio</h3>
          <p>Thomas Edison had used perforated 35mm film in the Kinetoscope, and in 1909 this was adopted as the worldwide industry standard. The picture had a width-to-height relationship—known as the aspect ratio—of 4:3 or 1.33:1. The first number refers to the width of the screen, and the second to the height. So for example, for every 4 centimetres in width, there will be 3 in height.</p>
          <p>With the advent of optical sound, the aspect ratio was adjusted to 1.37:1. This is known as the ‘Academy ratio’, as it was officially approved by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (the Oscars people) in 1932.</p>
          <p>Although there were many experiments with other formats, there were no major changes in screen ratios until the 1950s.</p>
